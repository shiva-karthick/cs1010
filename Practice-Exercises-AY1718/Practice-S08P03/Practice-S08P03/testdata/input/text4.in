A passage from a book published in the 1960s:
Yet this distance, all those abysses unbridged and then unbridgeable
by radio, television, cheap travel and the rest, was not wholly bad.
People knew less of each other, so were more individual. The entire
world was not for them only a push or switch away. Strangers were
strange, and sometimes with an exciting, beautiful strangeness. It
may be better for humanity that we should communicate more and more.
But I am a heretic, I think our ancestor's isolation was like the
greater space they enjoyed: it can only be envied. The world is only
too literally too much with us now.
